Start with =cargo run=. Then, you can send HTTP requests to the server
at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Try to send many requests and look at the log of the server, to see how
requests are handled concurrently, although we're only executing
requests on one thread. The reactor runs in it's own I/O polling thread.

For example, you can send a file:

#+begin_src sh
while true; do curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8000/upload' \--form 'file=@/home/somewhere/some_image.png' -w ' Total: %{time_total}' && echo '\n'; done;
#+end_src
