fn call(mut f: impl FnMut() + Copy) {

fn g(mut f: impl FnMut() + Copy) {
    f();
    call(f);
    f();
    call(f);

fn main() {

/*
The object passed into g is a FnMut closure which captures an integer by value. Effectively it's an unnameable struct containing a single field whose type is i32, with a function call operator that takes &mut self:

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct UnnameableClosure {
    i: i32,
}

impl UnnameableClosure {
    pub fn unnameable_call_operator(&mut self) {
        self.i += 1;
        print!("{}", self.i);
    }
}

let mut i = 0i32;
g(UnnameableClosure { i });
The behavior of the 4 calls inside g is as follows:

f() runs the closure and its by-value captured value of i becomes 1.

call(f) makes a copy of f to become the argument of call. The copy gets executed and its i becomes 2, but the original closure still holds a value of 1 for its captured i. The copy of the closure gets dropped as it goes out of scope at the end of the body of call.

f() runs the original closure a second time and its i becomes 2.

call(f) copies f a second time and executes the copy, its i becomes 3.

Since Rust 1.26, closures automatically implement Clone if all their captures implement Clone, and Copy if all the captures implement Copy.

If the move keyword were omitted from the quiz code, the compiler-generated closure would capture i by mutable reference instead of by value:

pub struct UnnameableClosure<'a> {
    i: &'a mut i32,
}
and there would no longer be a Copy impl, because it's incorrect to duplicate a mutable reference into multiple copies (aliasing xor mutation; this is the point of the borrow checker).

One recurring source of confusion for Rust beginners is the relationship between move and non-move closures vs Fn and FnMut and FnOnce closures. These are two nearly-orthogonal things. As illustrated in the UnnameableClosure pseudocode above, move vs non-move is about whether the fields of the compiler-generated closure struct have the same type as the original captured variable's type, vs are references to the original captured variable's type (i32 vs &mut i32, for example). In contrast, Fn vs FnMut vs FnOnce is about whether the call method of the compiler-generated closure struct has a receiver which is &self vs &mut self vs self.
