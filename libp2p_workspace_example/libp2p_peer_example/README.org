An example for building a simple peer to peer application using Rust

Run with =RUST_LOG=info cargo run= in multiple terminals, preferably in
different folders, each containing a different, or empty =recipes.json=
file.

Upon starting, press enter to start the application. The application
expects a =recipes.json= file in the folder where it's executed.

There are several commands:

- =ls p= - list all peers
- =ls r= - list local recipes
- =ls r all= - list all public recipes from all known peers
- =ls r {peerId}= - list all public recipes from the given peer
- =create r Name|Ingredients|Instructions= - create a new recipe with
  the given data, the =|= are important as separators
- =publish r {recipeId}= - publish recipe with the given recipe ID
