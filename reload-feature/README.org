This examples shows to make hot reloading configurable using a feature.

For development use two terminals and run the binary

#+begin_src shell
cargo watch -i lib -x 'run --features reload'
#+end_src

and (re-)build the lib

#+begin_src shell
cargo watch -w lib -x build
#+end_src

To run with a statically compiled binary just do

#+begin_src shell
cargo run
#+end_src
